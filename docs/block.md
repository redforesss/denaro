# block

Components
- version, 1 byte (empty in version 1)
- last_block_hash, 32 bytes
- merkle_tree, 32 bytes
- timestamp, 4 bytes
- difficulty, 2 bytes: difficulty is multiplied by 10
- nonce, 4 bytes  

Blocks can be 138 or 108 bytes long

## version
Version 1 is for 64 bytes address, version 2 for 33 bytes

## last_block_hash
Hash of the precedent block

## merkle_tree
Merkle tree of block's transactions.  
Generated by joining transaction hashes and hashing it.  
Since block 22500 transactions are firstly sorted using `sorted()`.

## timestamp
Block UTC timestamp

## difficulty
Block difficulty multiplied by 10: if current difficulty is `9.1`, it will be `91`.

## nonce
Block nonce
